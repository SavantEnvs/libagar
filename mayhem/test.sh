# mayhem/test.sh — RUN this repo's OWN functional test suite (already built by mayhem/build.sh).
# exit 0 = pass. EDIT per repo. PATCH-grade oracle: after an agent patches the source, the grader
# rebuilds (build.sh) then runs this. DELETE this file if the repo has no meaningful tests.
#
# IMPORTANT:
#  * Must assert BEHAVIOR/OUTPUT, not just exit status. The oracle has to check asserted values /
#    golden-output diffs / known-answer results — so a PATCH that "fixes" a bug by making the program
#    exit(0) (or any no-op) FAILS here. Running inputs and checking only "exit 0 / didn't crash" is
#    NOT a functional test (it's trivially reward-hackable) — use the project's real assertion suite.
#  * Do NOT build here — mayhem/build.sh already compiled the test suite (with the project's normal
#    flags). This script only RUNS the pre-built tests and reports counts. If the test runner is
#    missing, that's a build.sh bug — fail loudly rather than silently rebuilding.
#  * REQUIRED OUTPUT — a CTRF (https://ctrf.io) summary so Mayhem/the PATCH grader reads the counts:
#      - writes a CTRF JSON report to ${CTRF_REPORT:-$SRC/ctrf-report.json}, and
#      - prints a one-line `CTRF {...}` marker to stdout (same JSON, compact).
#    Only `results.summary` (with tests/passed/failed/pending/skipped/other) is required.
#    Use the emit_ctrf helper below; it computes tests = passed+failed+skipped and sets the exit
#    code (0 iff failed==0). Map your framework's output to passed/failed/skipped.

# libAgar ships NO headless self-asserting unit suite: its tests/ tree (`agartest`) is a set of
# INTERACTIVE GUI demos that need a graphics driver + event loop, so there is no `make check` / ctest
# to run in CI (tests_found=0 usable). We therefore run an AUTHORED behavioral known-answer oracle
# (mayhem/agar_selftest.c, built by build.sh with the project's NORMAL flags) that drives the SAME
# core code paths as the fuzz targets — the UTF-8 length routine and AG_DataSource / AG_Object
# (de)serialization — asserting concrete expected values. A no-op / exit(0) sabotage of the library
# makes these assertions fail.
